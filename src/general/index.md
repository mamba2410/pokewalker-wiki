# General Info

This wiki aims to document some details about the Pokewalker in a more organised way
than Dmitry's original article.
Also included will be more information and an expanded scope than the article also.

The wiki is divided into different sections, mostly aimed at people developing
things for the Pokewalker.

- The [behaviour](../behaviour/index.md) section details the inner workings of
    certain modules and sub-modules of the walker.
- The [manipulation](../manipulation/index.md) section details things that can be
    done to manipulate things on the walker, such as RCE and re-flashing the firmware
    on the walker.

There are also sections for the [EEPROM map](../eeprom_map.md), [data structures](../structs.md)
used in the walker as well as all of the [IR commands](../ir_commands.md) used in comms between the
walker and either the DS or another walker.

This wiki aims to be actively updated whenever new discoveries are made for the walker.
