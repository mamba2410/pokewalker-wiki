| 00                      | g2w      | Compressed EEPROM write. Documented at length above. Writes 128 bytes on a 128-byte boundary. "extra" byte is top 8 bits of address. Bottom 8 bits will always be zero. Reply will be CMD_04                                                                                                         |

| 10                      | w2w      | Sent by the master walker in a peer-play scenario at start. Enclosed is 0x68 bytes of data - the "IDENTITY DATA". The expected reply from the peer is CMD_12                                                                                                                                         |

| 1C                      | w2w      | Sent by the either walker during peer play when it's detected that it's "played" with this peer too recently. Shows the "Cannot connect to trainer again" error. No data.                                                                                                                            |

| 2A                      | g2w, w2g | Data is "UNIQUE ID DATA", used to set RTC. Erases the walker. Differs somehow from CMD_2C. Reply is CMD_2A, 0x28 bytes, "UNIQUE ID DATA" which is now all 0xFF. This command is actually used by the game to reset the walker                                                                        |

See CMD_5A for details.                                                                                                                            |
| 40                      | g2w      | Same as CMD_32. Data is "IDENTITY DATA" that master sends to the slave. From it only RTC is used, if a flag is set. Reply from the walker will be CMD_42                                                                                                                                             |
